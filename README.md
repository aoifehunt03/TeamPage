SUMMARY OF PROJECT
____________________

Our project is based on the idea of creating a singing buzzer.
We pulled code from other sources and had hoped to edit it to create more songs or tunes of an easier nature.
The project we have designed will feature the Arduino grove/Yun kit, and we will code the buzzer within the software to sing a simple tune.

From this, we hope to include an internet element that allows us to track changes through a spreadsheet, and if possible we would like to input changes to the notes through a browser.

So far we have a few working songs, but we aim to make the code ours and more personal to the team.

Sonic Pi Update:
We have switched to a more suited language and software to work with, which included Ruby code language, and using Sonic Pi and a possibility of adding the Raspberry Pi kit later once we are confident in our ability to work with this new equipment. 
We are currently using the speakers built into the laptop device, but plan on learning more about this language.
