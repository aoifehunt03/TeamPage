SUMMARY OF PROJECT
____________________

Our project is based on the idea of creating a singing buzzer.
We pulled code from other sources and hope to edit it to create more songs or tunes of an easier nature.
The project we have designed will feature the Arduino grove/Yun kit, and we will code the buzzer within the software to sing a simple tune.

From this, we hope to include an internet element that allows us to track changes through a spreadsheet, and if possible we would like to input changes to the notes through a browser.

So far we have a working song, but we aim to make the code ours and more personal to the team.
